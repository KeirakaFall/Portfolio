    <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
    <p>
    <b>What project are you working on currently?</b><br>
    I am currently working on my game Evanesce.<br>
    <br>
    <b>What is the project about?</b><br>
    Telling the story here would be spoiling, so here is the setting to the game!<br>
    Evanesce's setting place in a much older earth after a portion of humanity was transported to the future.<br>
    The advanced humans, which at this point are gods, did this as a way to keep a population of non celestial humans alive on earth.<br>
